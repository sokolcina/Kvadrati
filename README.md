# Kvadrati
 This application have a form containing one canvas for drawing on the left. Clicking on the canvas creates a new square of d by d. The top left coordinate-x coordinate should be the x coordinate of the click location. The square should be lowered until it reaches the end of the canvas or until it reaches another square. Squares cannot intersect. Application have a text box on the right where user can type d (dimensions of squares).
 
When creating squares, they can be colored in one of eight colors. Colors need to change (two consecutive squares do not need to be colored in the same color). Also, every color should be equally represented. By clicking on the square, it is selected. When a square is selected, his color changes into black, which is different from the other eight colors. By clicking on delete button, the selected square will be deleted and all squares above it will drop down. The squares should be subject to the rule that they do not intersect and below them is the other square or lower border of the canvas.
